Let us walk through the process of configuring a Git server, ssh-keygen utility generates public/private RSA key pair, that we will use for user authentication.

Open a terminal and enter the following command and just press enter for each input. After successful completion, it will create a .ssh directory inside the home directory.

tom@CentOS ~]$ pwd
/home/tom

[tom@CentOS ~]$ ssh-keygen
The above command will produce the following result.

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/tom/.ssh/id_rsa): Press Enter Only
Created directory '/home/tom/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): ---------------> Press Enter Only
Enter same passphrase again: ------------------------------> Press Enter Only
Your identification has been saved in /home/tom/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/tom/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
df:93:8c:a1:b8:b7:67:69:3a:1f:65:e8:0e:e9:25:a1 tom@CentOS
The key's randomart image is:
